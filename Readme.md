This code implements a simple sentiment analysis model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) with the NLTK library and the Scikit-learn library in Python. Below is a detailed breakdown of the code:

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Import Libraries**:
    ```python
    import nltk
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
    from nltk.corpus import movie_reviews
    ```
   - `nltk`: Natural Language Toolkit, used for working with human language data.
   - `pandas`: A library for data manipulation and analysis, especially for structured data.
   - `CountVectorizer`: Converts a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts (bag of words model).
   - `train_test_split`: Splits data arrays into two subsets (training and testing).
   - `MultinomialNB`: A Naive Bayes classifier for multinomially distributed data, suitable for text classification.
   - `accuracy_score` and `classification_report`: Metrics to evaluate the model's performance.
   - `movie_reviews`: A dataset from NLTK containing movie reviews categorized as positive or negative.

2. **Setup**:
    ```python
    # Step 1: Setup - Install necessary libraries (if not installed)
    # !pip install nltk pandas scikit-learn
    ```
   - This comment indicates that if the required libraries are not installed, the user should run the pip command to install them.

3. **Data Preparation**:
    ```python
    nltk.download("movie_reviews")
    ```
   - Downloads the movie reviews dataset if it’s not already downloaded.

   ```python
    # Load the dataset
    documents = [
        (" ".join(movie_reviews.words(fileid)), category)
        for category in movie_reviews.categories()
        for fileid in movie_reviews.fileids(category)
    ]
   ```
   - Loads the dataset into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a review (joined into a single string) and its corresponding sentiment (category: 'pos' or 'neg').

   ```python
    # Convert to DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame(documents, columns=["review", "sentiment"])
   ```
   - Converts the list of tuples into a Pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation and analysis.

4. **Model Training**:
    ```python
    # Convert text data to feature vectors
    vectorizer = CountVectorizer(max_features=2000)
    X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df["review"])
    y = df["sentiment"]
    ```
   - The `CountVectorizer` converts the text reviews into a numerical format (feature vectors). The `max_features=2000` parameter limits the number of features to the top 2000 most common words.
   - `X` contains the feature vectors, and `y` contains the corresponding sentiments.

   ```python
    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
        X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
    )
   ```
   - Splits the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using a fixed random seed for reproducibility.

   ```python
    # Train a Naive Bayes classifier
    model = MultinomialNB()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```
   - Initializes the Naive Bayes classifier and fits it on the training data.

   ```python
    # Evaluate the model
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}")
    print(f"Classification Report:\n{classification_report(y_test, y_pred)}")
   ```
   - Uses the trained model to predict sentiments on the test data, calculates accuracy, and prints a detailed classification report, including precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Prediction Function**:
    ```python
    def predict_sentiment(text):
        text_vector = vectorizer.transform([text])
        prediction = model.predict(text_vector)
        return prediction[0]
    ```
   - Defines a function to predict the sentiment of new input text. It transforms the input text into the same feature vector format used for training, and then predicts the sentiment.

6. **Testing the Prediction Function**:
    ```python
    # Test the prediction function
    print(predict_sentiment("I absolutely loved this movie! It was fantastic."))
    print(predict_sentiment("It was a terrible film. I hated it."))
    print(predict_sentiment("The movie was okay, nothing special."))
    ```
   - Tests the `predict_sentiment` function with different example sentences to show how the model predicts sentiments.

### Hurray

This code creates a sentiment analysis model that processes movie reviews, trains a Naive Bayes classifier, evaluates its performance, and allows for predictions on new reviews. It's a practical example of applying NLP techniques using Python and popular libraries. If you have any specific questions about any part of the code or concepts involved, feel free to ask!

### Beauty of MultinomialNB

- MultinomialNB is a Naive Bayes classifier that is particularly suited for classification tasks where the input features are discrete counts
- It is widely used in text classification problems, such as spam detection and sentiment analysis. Here’s a detailed overview of its usage and characteristics
- MultinomialNB is based on Bayes' theorem, which calculates the probability of a class based on prior knowledge and evidence from the features. It assumes that the features are conditionally independent given the class label.
- This classifier works best with features that represent counts or frequencies, such as word counts in a document. It's commonly used in text classification problems where the features are the counts of words (bag-of-words model).It can handle high-dimensional sparse data effectively, which is common in text classification scenarios where documents may contain thousands of unique words.
- MultinomialNB is computationally efficient and can handle large datasets well. Its training and prediction times are generally low, making it suitable for applications that require real-time predictions.
